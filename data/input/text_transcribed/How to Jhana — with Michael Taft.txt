 Hello, my name is Michael Tafta and this is my video on how to Jhana. So we're going to learn today how to enter the first Jhana. So what's a Jhana? Jhana is a word that means to meditate, but in the context of Theravada Buddhism, old school Buddhism, it means a special state of absorption, a deep, absorbed concentration state that is particularly powerful. And we use Jhanas in order to deepen our concentration, deepen our unification of mind, purifying the mind so that we can, for example, do really good vipassana or really good non-dual practice and other deep transformative awakening practices. So Jhana is by itself really fun, but also it makes a great setup. It's a wonderful practice to deepen your absorption to allow you to do even more meditation work. So Jhanas are great and today I'll just briefly go into how to enter the first Jhana. So let's begin. So the very first thing to understand about Jhanas is everyone says they're about concentration, but that word is a little confusing in English because when we say concentration in English we kind of mean grabbing the mind of wrestling, the flashlight of attention and pointing on it at something and then keeping it there no matter what. So there's this sense of struggle and the sense of tightness and control and that's absolutely not what we want in Jhana. There's somewhere in the Pali Canon that the Buddha says, you know, someone asked him about how to do Jhanas or what Jhanas are for or about and he says Jhanas are about happiness, right? And this is the essence of understanding how to get into a Jhana. We're not trying to wrestle with the mind, we're not trying to control attention tightly or rigidly or with constriction, we're trying to be loose, relaxed, open and enjoy it. And so the word instead of concentration that I prefer is absorption or unification. And the idea of absorption or unification is that the mind kind of gathers naturally around something it finds very attractive. Okay, so understanding that what we're doing is gathering the mind around something pleasant, this is how we conceptualize the Jhana and it makes it much much easier to enter the Jhana. So in order to do this we start out doing some kind of shamata on an object. Shamata on an object means essentially concentration meditation on anything. Very often you'll hear people say that for Jhana you must focus at the breath at the nose or maybe breathing in the whole body and those are fine objects but honestly in order to do a Jhana you can concentrate on anything you want as long as it helps you get nice and focus and absorbed and unified. Right, so you can use a mantra, you can use a visualization. I like visualization to enter Jhana because it can get the mind very very absorbed and unified rapidly. Some people use fire casina for the same thing or other casinas. In fact casinas are for Jhana. That's why they were that practice was invented and a really interesting way to do the focus part of Jhana, the setup we might call it, is with meta, loving kindness meditation or compassion meditation. Why? Well again one of the things is we want to be focused on something pleasant and the Brahma Vihara states are very pleasant. Also though something that's important for the first Jhana is that what is called the hindrances or kind of the negative bummer qualities in your mind get reduced. In other words you're not actively worried, you're not actively struggling and trying to control, you're not actively angry or something while you're doing the Jhana practice. That's called you know abeyance or reduction of the hindrances and so what you want to do is get your mind and your body in a happy place and metta is really good for that. So no matter what your focus object is, whether it's some breath object or a mantra or a visualization or some other body object or meta or whatever for any of those it can be really good to just take a moment to like soften your heart or feel some joy or some gratitude when you begin because it really really helps engender that mood. So to begin going into the Jhana you're going to spend as long as it takes just meditating on your focus object in a relaxed heart open relatively peaceful and calm way and you're going to do that as long as it takes for something to start happening and the specific thing that needs to start happening is called piti. The piti needs to start arising. So what is piti? It's a word from the Pali language that the Buddhist suttas are written in. What is piti? Well it's funny when you read the translations of piti it's pretty clear that most of the people who are translating this word in the past anyway did not have experience with Jhana because they call it all kinds of things you know bliss and rapture and stuff but these are not good descriptions. The best description of piti is it's a body buzz a very pleasant body buzz and it can feel exactly like Kundalini type feelings, buzzy, tingly, energy feelings in the body or it can well actually it can go anywhere from kind of a light to warm fuzzy feeling when it's maybe kind of very very very soft and gentle sometimes it's like fireworks going off in your body when it's really unstable it'll be like a burst of piti burst of piti burst of piti you know you feel this tingliness in your body and it can go all the way up to this kind of volcano of orgasmic rapture like you're just getting incredibly intense body pleasure that is actually so intense it's a little uncomfortable and we'll talk about what to do with that but all of those are piti and what you want to do is concentrate on your focus object concentrate on your focus object in this happy relaxed non-struggly non-tight way it's got to be open heart melted peaceful happy right you're doing this in a very joyous and relaxed way without a lot of expectation and as you do that you will find that you you start feeling more and more positive sensations in your body your body will just start feeling good in fact many people use as their focus object deep belly breathing with these long slow breaths because that will tend to make piti happen anyway right that's like a Kundalini type breath and you'll feel very pleasant energy in your body arising when you do that and so no matter what your focus object is eventually the piti will start but you're not ready to go into the jhana yet because a lot of times the piti is momentary or very weak so you want it to be both stable so it's continuously present and also strong enough that you can focus on it if you want to so in other words you're waiting till the piti becomes stable and pretty reasonably strong so you're on your focus object you notice the piti is happening but you just keep going with your focus object just keep going with your focus object whatever it is until the piti is strong and stable and then you do the next thing and the next thing is the big thing so let's talk about that if there's one thing you remember from this entire video it's this when the piti gets strong and stable enough you switch your attention from your focus object whatever it is you take your mind off that you stop focusing on that and you move it to the piti in other words you move it to focusing on these pleasant sensations in your body now for some reason something about human physiology for most people the piti starts arising in their hands you'll feel this sense that your hands are like warm and energized and buzzy and tingly and they'll feel maybe big like big oven mittens or something and they feel really good and so you switch you take your attention off the focus object and put it on the piti in your hands or it might be in your throat or your face particularly your mouth the mouth can get filled with this very delicious piti and if it's there then you focus there so wherever the piti starts happening take it off focus object A put it on focus object B which is the piti and then leave it there okay so you switch focus objects and then you don't do anything more you simply rest the mind on the piti and leave it there in a very relaxed open pleasant manner if you try to force it or try to push the piti harder or try to kind of wrangle your way into the Jhana it will fail so again it's about being happy open relaxed the one thing you can do besides just being relaxed that helps a little bit is again you can have a mood of kindness towards the piti so let's say it's happening in your hands you just you kind of feel gratitude and joy for the piti or you just love it right and you kind of in your imagination beam this sense of love and gratitude towards the piti and there's something about that that will help and again you do this in a very relaxed easy manner so the piti is happening somewhere in your body and maybe you beam a little open-heartedness towards it a little love little kindness and you're with that and then you just stay there and that may go on for a while but what will happen and this is the big moment right is that at a certain point the piti on its own will just ramp up and it will ramp up a lot and it will take your mind and just trip into the Jhana your mind will just gather or unify like that's what the absorption is that's the unification your mind will unify around the piti and congratulations at that point you are in Jhana one the mind has gathered on the piti and you will definitely know it when it happens it's a very particular sense of being in an altered state and it's a really pleasant altered state so again you did it at that point and then once the piti arrives a number of things could happen one maybe it comes on you know you're in the Jhana and then you get excited and get tired and try to control it and play with it and what you just pop right out you were still in the Jhana but you were there for maybe you know 30 seconds or something but good you still achieved it and now try again and eventually you'll kind of get more relaxed when you're in the Jhana and then it will stay a lot longer so that's number one thing that can happen number two is that you don't get all excited and then flipped out and instead the piti arises you're in the Jhana and then it's relatively stable and you stay there and you kind of soak in the piti absorb in it even more you spread it throughout your body this is one of the interesting things once the piti is strong enough you can kind of move it to fill the rest of your whole body and then just absorb absorb absorb to the point when you're either done with the meditation or you want to move on either to a further Jhana or to work on your Vipassana which would be a very good thing to do or to work on your non-dual practice or whatever so you go into the into the Jhana and it's stable and you work with it from there that's number two the third thing that can happen and this is not that rare it happens pretty often is that the piti arises there's like this mushroom event of the piti just suddenly and it is really strong it's so strong that it's uncomfortable it makes you feel like you can't breathe it makes you feel like you're going to explode so it just came on stronger than you were ready for and if that's the case sometimes it pops you back out because you're like whoa that's too much and then if that if it's too much that pops you out you just work on it again you know a little more relaxed a little more openness and see if it can come on more smoothly next time or maybe less intensely but another thing is possible which is let's say it comes on really strong it's uncomfortable it's too much but you stay with it for maybe a minute or two and then you can just move on to the second Jhana right one way past this intense piti is sort of through it and so if you're going to do that then you go into the second Jhana and the second Jhana instead of focused on this body buzz this little buzzy tingly energy it's focused on joy on happiness on just straight up joy and usually that's centered around your mouth not always it can be in the heart it can be other places but for many people it's just this big big big grin of joy and it turns out if you switch from the piti onto the joy which is instead of a body buzz it's an emotional flavor right and you focus on that it's much more refined it's much it's like going from really coarse burlap or something to silk it's like going from crunchy being a butter to smooth even though I like crunchy better in this case the smooth is really nice right it's because it's smoother and so you go into the second Jhana into the happiness and and maybe you can stabilize there congratulations you've already gone into the second Jhana so that's great so this is how we do it that's it for going into Jhana one and maybe even Jhana two the cool thing about the Jhana is is there great for a number of things one is you can just get involved in developing the Jhana for a while so stabilizing Jhana one and two deepening them working on three and four or even going to the formless Jhana's after that you know this is its own long and you know effortful it's a it's a it's a long path development of the refinement of the mind and this is worth doing on its own it's a very powerful practice it's a life-changing practice if you learn to have you know wonderful body tingliness wonderful joy in Jhana three peacefulness and Jhana form equanimity if you learn to do these at this very deep very stable level it's going to change your day very significantly because you can just learn to bring on non-jonic levels but still powerful levels of joy on demand tranquility and equanimity on demand you've really trained your mind into these very deep very positive states and part of doing that is the mind has become more subtle or refined it's a more it's a sharper more and more stable and it has more finesse it's a real benefit just to work on the Jhana's by themselves many texts say that there's a potential that you could get like addicted to the Jhana's because they're so nice but I never met anyone who was like addictive to Jhana's maybe this is something that happened in the past but most people you know get really good at them if they work at it and then move on to the other things you can do with Jhana but even by themselves Jhana's are a great meditation object and many people love working with them what can you do when you get better at them well for example you can work then on your Vipassana in the the scriptures of the Pali Canon the Buddha makes it clear that Jhana is the prerequisite for insight when you have a Jhana level concentration a Jhana level absorption your mind is unified like that then it is powerful enough to do Vipassana well you can get insight and move on into stream entry and so on so it's really super powerful very fun and fascinating to ramp up your concentration level to the Jhana level so that you can then do insight and that's very worth doing another thing a non-traditional thing you can do with it is use the stability and sharpness of the Jhana focused mind to work on non dual type practices you know awareness of awareness practice when the mind is refined and stable enough that becomes much much easier and of course these later Buddhist traditions use either Jhana's or things that teach Jhana level concentration to do non dual type practices so in other words the Jhana's are this great platform set up themselves either to you know just work on in their own right to refine the mind or to use as a like a base camp for going to these higher peaks of meditation skill and insight and awakening so if you get good at even Jhana one that is very useful somewhere in the suit as the Buddha says you know Jhana for is sort of really reliable for producing awakening but even Jhana one is enough concentration to get awakening and so it's really useful even at that early stage so I hope that you consider working with Jhana's some of the things that will help you are books and audio tapes and so on the best ones that I found the very very best one I think is the book right concentration by Lee Brazington and Lee is a friend of mine he's a great guy you can listen to a deconstructing yourself podcast where he talks about Jhana and his book is just simple it's straight to the point it's no nonsense and if you follow his steps you will get to the first job it might take you a while you might have to go to a retreat but if you work at this diligently you can do it most people can do it another really powerful book with a lot of information is the mind illuminated by Chuladasa he really goes into the different depths of Jhana so you know we talked about Jhana one two three four in a sequence but there's also depth this way where you can be in a light one or as medium one or in a light one or as medium one or a really really deep Jhana one and so on with the others so there's the second dimension of depth and Chuladasa makes all that very clear and puts it in a nice chart in his book and also gives a lot of really useful instruction on how to go into the Jhana's very worth reading then there's the English teacher Rob Berbea who recently did an entire Jhana retreat and recorded it so that's at the Dharma Seed audio library so you can get audio recordings and spore free of that entire very deep very powerful Jhana retreat where he gives unbelievably complete instructions lots and lots and lots of hints and tips and tricks and also guided meditations about Jhana it's so worth it it's a great resource and even better there's a 457 page PDF like that thick transcription of that retreat download it print it out write all over it make notes really dedicate yourself to your Jhana practice and get in that first Jhana and get your mind cleansed clarified refined and stabilized so that your practice can be awesome so that's my instruction video on how to Jhana I really hope it helps you I hope you get into the Jhana's I hope you read the books I hope you do the practices and I hope that you achieve the Jhana's so that you can use them to you know vastly improve your life to clarify your mind to deepen your absorption to have a happier life and also to use them as a platform for awakening that's the real purpose so I really hope that you do that and if you like this video please subscribe to
