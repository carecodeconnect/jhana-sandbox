 Good morning or good evening in whichever part of the world you are in. Today I thought about doing a guided meditation to attain both Rupa and Arupa Jhanas. I will be referring to Jhana Sutta. This comes under Anguta Nikaya 9.36. Then Samanna Palasutta, Dheganikaaya 2. And Chula Shunyata Sutta. This would be Majjimani Kaya 121. What I found is that all these three gives a good foundation and also helps us to attain all the 9 Jhanas. And it also teaches what should be expected when we get into each one of these Jhanas. So the first step is to pray to Lord Buddha or have a Vandana. So that the thoughts which are of worldly get cut and establish the necessary condition for the Jhana. So let's start. Namotas Bhagavato Arhatos Sammasambuddhas Take a mini-tort to reflect upon Namotas Bhagavato Arhatos Sammasambuddhas. Prostration to Bhagavata Bhava plus Gha plus Va. That is one who knows the causes and condition for rebirth. Arhatos, one who has destroyed the enemies of Raghad Vesamoho, Sammasambuddha. By his own paramis he has achieved the ending of craving and ending of defilements. Buddha, Sarna, Gacchami Dhamma, Sarna, Gacchami Sangham, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Buddha, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Dhammam, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Sangham, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Buddha, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Dhammam, Sarna, Gacchami Dutiyampe Sangham, Sarna, Gacchami Sarna, Gamanam, Sampunnam Again a two minute reflection on what is Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. As in iti piso bhagava, then when it comes to Dhamma, swakhato bhagavata dhammo, and when it comes to Sangha, swakhato bhagavata dhammo, and Sangha. This reflection removes the visik iccha, doubt on the meaning of Buddha or Dhamma or Sangha. This is almost a must for us to cross beyond the fourth jhana. So I suggest you go through one of my video on Buddha Vandana or you can read through on the internet on iti piso bhagava and all that. So let's reflect for a minute or two. Thank you. Now let us establish the five precepts. Pana tipata vairamani sikha padam samhadhya me Adinna dana vairamani sikha padam samhadhya me Kamesu mithcha chara vairamani sikha padam samhadhya me Mosa vada vairamani sikha padam samhadhya me Sura mera yama japa maddhathana vairamani sikha padam samhadhya me Imani pancha sikha padam samhadhya me Imani pancha sikha padam samhadhya me Imani pancha sikha padam samhadhya me Tisaranena saddhim pancha selam dhammam sadhukam surakitam kathwa Appamadhinasampadhitam Now let us reflect these five precepts. For two minutes this will establish the kama chanda and bhyapada, tennamida, kokucha udhachya to be lessened so that one can enter into first jana. Using etan, santan, etan, panetan. So let us take two minutes to reflect upon these five precepts. Now let us take two minutes to reflect upon these five precepts. Now let us take two minutes to reflect upon these five precepts. Now let us take two minutes to reflect upon these five precepts. Now let us take two minutes to reflect upon these five precepts. Now let us proceed further. Now we are going to recite etan, santan, etan, panetan. This will be for three times and with that we will be able to cut the initial thoughts which keeps on debating called vittakka and pondering over that is called vichara or than or rather thinking. So let us start. etan, santan, etan, panetan. yadidam sabha sankhara samatha sabbhupadi patin nisaggo tan hakha yo firagho nirodho nipananti etan, santan, etan, panetan. yadidam sabha sankhara samatha sabbhupadi patin nisaggo tan hakha yo firagho nirodho nipananti etan, santan, etan, panetan. yadidam sabha sankhara samatha sabbhupadi patin nisaggo tan hakha yo firagho nirodho nipananti Now finally, let us establish aniccha dukkha anatha in the five aggregates because they have been arising and passing away from the morning till now or like yesterday, day before yesterday, they all have gone we cannot hold on to those so rupa maniccha vedanani ccha sannyani ccha sankhara aniccha vinyanani ccha yadani cham taddukkham because we cannot catch it, hold it, make it as oneself and hence it is anatha so it is like a disease if I were to hold it it is like a boil or a wound it is like an arrow shot on my forearm so there is tremendous pain and discomfort and if I were to hold it of yesterday's experience or experience what I had ten minutes ago five minutes ago like falling apart and hence it is sunya without any essence and empty now the heart starts expanding there are no thoughts enter into the first jhana you you you you you now this experience would be as indicated in the saman nip fallah sutra as though you have a sponge, your whole body is like a sponge which is soaked up with a nice bathing powder water is being put little by little and nothing is coming out of it but yet it is all wet everywhere so right now your body feels extremely light and there is no part in your body where there is no vibration there is a nice peaceful vibration so now your mind is secluded from sensual pleasures and you have the joy or the rapture and you have the joy and you have the joy and you have the joy and you have the joy and you are feeling blissful now let's come to the second jhana now there is no vittak vichara vittak vichara but you have piti sukha ekagata so now your body is undergoing change like you have stepped into a cool refreshing water and you are enjoying the coolness of this crystal clear water so that's the feeling of joy so let's enjoy this for some time you you you you the in breath and out breath is becoming very thin very light feeling in the body almost to an extent that you are not breathing you you let's now proceed to the third jhana watching like this the body becomes even more lighter and the body disappears almost and the mind doesn't have any pain it's as though somebody has left the prisoner after long stay and he or she is saying the outside life for the very first time the sukha the bliss which is coming just watch it it's like somebody is standing below a waterfall how somebody is in a pond of lily and enjoying and watching how these plants are completely immersed but they are in bloom your mind is blooming in the same way the search of happiness is done it's not only cool and refreshing it's so peaceful so this is what you will experience in third jhana enjoy this for some time thanks for watching you you you you as we could see the mind has given its upadana or clinging on to the five aggregates it's not holding on to the rupa vedana sannyana sankhara vinyana it is not any longer having nicha sannyana instead it has anicha sannyana it no longer has atta it is established with anatta dukha and able to see the dukha dukha of attaching to it now there is no attachment so with that one can go into the fourth jhana for the fourth jhana let us refer to the chulasunyatasutta what you need to consider is that make this earth from the place you are sitting to everywhere covered with a cloth as far as you can take it covering the valleys, streams, mountains as though they are just a sheet Buddha gives an example of buffalo skin buffalo skin spread out everywhere we can use either cloth or buffalo or we can make it like a desert sand or sand dunes everywhere in that way the raga and the dvesha liking and disliking would go away consider that establish it and once you have succeeded that equanimity will follow and that is the the the the the the the the the the the God the you you well it is getting you you you you Now let us come to the aroopa Janas The first Jan of the aroopa is infinite space Now that we have spread out the Cloth across the earth As far as we can see That means there are no buildings There are no valleys there are no lakes there are nothing just a white sheet Now the sky and this earth Looks the same So you have space all around No difference in the space just the space Now you are an infinite space If you can consider the earth as like that you come out of earth You'll find only space everywhere And as much as your mind goes that much it can expand So your mind keeps expanding and expanding and expanding endlessly you Enjoy this infinite space you you you you you you Now let us move into infinite consciousness To attain this You should have experienced the boothers I Suggest You refer to Mahatana Kaya Sutra For experiencing Buddha However, Buddha is a Po Tejo and Why? What I need to do now Is to observe the path of the dhatu It's hard and soft and let go of that Internally also it is the same externally also it is the same Apo dhatu like in the case of saliva sweat urine Just let it go outside also the same externally Internally also same so there is no exclusive but we for me exclusive Apo Then temperature Tejo dhatu Place I'm sitting is either hot or cold Internally also same Externally also same Then why your dhatu in breath out breath Circulation which is happening Intestinal gases abdominal gases Here from the chest to the head and here from below the chest to Every part of the body Internally also the same externally also the same Now when done correctly You Can see a bright light Which covers you up completely In this Samanya Palasutta In the fourth Jhana Buddha explains this Like a wide sheet of cloth covered from head to toe And you see it like a light Pure and bright And there is no body There is just this light Now everywhere it is consciousness Just the light Like the Sun shining everywhere Do not imagine You would experience it to yourself Enjoy the infinite consciousness You You Let's proceed further Into a Kincha Ayatana In English it is called nothingness So Because of this consciousness There are no objects which are hitting onto the sense doors The eye sense door the ear sense door the no sense door like that It's like The senses have gone to sleep So when we sleep in the night Go to the deep sleep state There are no objects Which are hitting the sense door And hence you cannot Say what you were doing in deep sleep So the question where to be asked what were you doing You can only say I was sleeping because there is no eye Which is remaining there You don't remember having an eye there Or myself being there or Herself being there and there are no Impressions at all on the mind So you don't have any of this sense objects coming to the sense doors You You You You You Moving on to the age on Neva Sanya Nasa Nya Ayatana Like in the deep sleep Here you don't know whether you exist or you don't exist that I Now has become so subtle That you cannot make out any identity at all But Yet there seems to be an indication of identity This one you will experience When your Sealer is perfected This is beyond the deep sleep state Where there are no Ayatanas And That is what the seventh Jhana was a King Chayatana There should be a Very subtle feeling of I Otherwise You're almost released Because there is no I at all You You You You You Now let us move to the last Jhana ninth one Here we need to check the three sankharas Number one is a Chitta sankhara Vedana and Sanya First one to investigate is Sanya Need to see whether it is any chance and your niche a son by now Anikya Sanya would have got completely established You can see everything arising and passing away The labels are gone labels as in the name For instance, my name is Vilas It's the label Behind the label This body is fading away moment by moment It's diminishing it is decaying Same thing with all the impressions I have so called I I Everything is arising and passing away like my birth Arouse passed away Then as a small child Just passed away Then as a boy Attending to school has arisen and passed away As a teenager Gain horizon and passed away as a youth That has arisen and passed away As a married person Arisen and passed away As a middle-aged That is our eyes and and passing away So is the Vedana Now it is an it is Sanya and upeka as the Vedana So that is established Vachi sankhara has no Vita ka in vichara Kai sankhara has no asa passa In breath out breath which changes due to the mind Only the life faculty exists The breathing has only the prana or in Pali pana That's all what is existing So there is no other Sanya No symbolization No designations no title No conditioning As this or that And because there is no conditioning there is no I And hence Vedana is also nirodha So it's Sanya, Vedayita, nirodha So With this all the defilements All the asava Will get removed What remains after this? After this Chetavimukti is just The six faculties And the live stream Which is also called as bhava and gachitta Nothing else exists And now we can see that everything is aniccha in nature Holding onto it is dukkha And everything Is no There is no personality Nothing to call as myself So The tanha is broken down Craving for sensual pleasure Craving for existence bhavatana Craving for non-existence vibhavatana Is not there Without tanha there is no padana Without any clinging There cannot be any becoming And without becoming there can't be any jati Birth of a condition If there is no jati there is no jara Decay of that condition If there is no decay then there is no death And the entire dukkha cycle is removed You You So one should keep on checking on the chitta sankhara Whether it is creating nitya sannyara and the veda of Sukha and dukkha and Vachi sankhara with akka vichara will automatically happen if there is nitya sannyara and Sukha and dukkha and kaya sankhara will happen when The breath changes So there is excitement When there is Sukha and dukkha But when it is anichya sannyara The vedana becomes upekra And hence there is no vita kavichara And because of that There is no kaya sankhara Except for life faculty Jeevita indriya nothing else exists So this is how one can Establish from the first jana using 8th and santa 8th and panitana To the 9th jana You can refer to all the 3 sutras And attain release May you attain nibbana at the earliest May this practice of jana help you in Removing the defilements So the sutras to be Looked into or verified is jana sutta Angutra nikaaya 9.36 Samanna pala sutta Dheega nikaaya 2 And finally Chula sunyata sutta Majjima nikaaya 121 This would help you tremendously Experience the janas As Buddha gives simile of what you should do and what you should find Thank you very much Let there be peace Sadhu sadhu Sadhu
